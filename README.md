# Hi :wave:

My name is Shawn Kost, and I am a full-stack web developer. Since a young age I have had a love for anything that involves computers and technology. I began with technical theater learning the ins and outs of stage production and lighting design. That passion has only grown with time which led to my first job as a computer technician, where I integrated computer systems & servers. Ultimately this led me to discovering the world of computer programming with an immense desire to pursue a career within it!
